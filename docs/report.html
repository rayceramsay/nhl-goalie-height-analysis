<h1 class="title toc-ignore">The Impact of Height on NHL Goalies</h1>
<h4 class="author">Rayce Ramsay</h4>
<h4 class="date">2025-04-30</h4>

</div>


<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the fast-paced and ever-changing landscape of the National Hockey
League (NHL), goaltenders play a critical role in determining the
outcome of games. Their ability to stop players from scoring using
speed, agility, and positioning makes them one of the most scrutinized
positions in professional hockey. Over the years, there has been ongoing
debate regarding the ideal physical attributes of a successful
goaltender, particularly when discussing height. While some argue that
taller goalies have an advantage due to their greater net coverage,
others suggest that shorter goalies may compensate with quicker reflexes
and mobility.</p>
<p>This study examines the relationship between a goaltender’s height
and their success in the NHL. Specifically, we analyze whether there has
been a historical trend in goalie height over the past 25 years and
whether this trend varies by country of origin. Additionally, we explore
whether taller goalies exhibit better statistical performance as
measured by save percentage (SV%) and goals against average (GAA)
compared to their shorter counterparts. Answering these questions should
provide insights into the evolving profile of NHL goaltenders and
contribute to the broader discussion on goalie development and scouting
strategies.</p>
<p>The data used in this study is sourced from publicly available NHL
statistics, including goalie biographies and performance metrics from
all seasons since 2000. This dataset has 2256 observations across 34
variables, featuring personal details such as the goaltender’s name,
height, birth country, and what season they played in. Performance
indicators like number of games played, number of shots faced, save
percentage, and goals against average are also included per season.
Additionally, we will assess a separate dataset that features the
heights of officially ranked NHL goalie prospects from each draft year
since 2008. This dataset includes 869 observations across 15 variables
with each prospect identified as either North American or international.
Finally, we will also use a team-oriented dataset to control for
external factors that may impact goaltender performance. This dataset
has 490 rows across 6 variables, including expected goals against,
number of blocked shots, and number of defensive zone giveaways for each
team and season combination since 2008. Through these datasets, we aim
to provide a data-driven approach to analyzing the impact of height on
NHL goaltending performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level2">
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The goalie and prospect data for this study was mainly collected from
a publicly available (but undocumented) NHL API, using two primary base
URLs: <a href="https://api.nhle.com/stats/rest/"
class="uri">https://api.nhle.com/stats/rest/</a> and <a
href="https://api-web.nhle.com/"
class="uri">https://api-web.nhle.com/</a>. Since no official
documentation exists, queries were structured based on an unofficial API
reference guide from GitHub (<a
href="https://github.com/Zmalski/NHL-API-Reference"
class="uri">https://github.com/Zmalski/NHL-API-Reference</a>) and
cross-referenced with the official NHL website (<a
href="https://www.nhl.com/stats/goalies"
class="uri">https://www.nhl.com/stats/goalies</a>) to ensure accuracy.
Two primary datasets were obtained: goalie season data, covering every
NHL season (i.e. regular season and playoffs combined) since 2000, and
prospect data, covering pre-NHL Entry Draft rankings for every year
since 2008. The goalie season data was retrieved through a series of
separate API requests for summary statistics and biographies, which were
then merged using unique player and season identifiers. Similarly,
prospect data was gathered through separate requests for North American
and international goalies and aggregated into a single dataset. An
additional column indicating prospect origin (i.e. North American or
not) was added during the merging process. All data was exported to CSV
files for further processing.</p>
<p>In contrast to the goalie and prospect data, team defense metrics
were collected from <a href="https://moneypuck.com/data.htm"
class="uri">https://moneypuck.com/data.htm</a>, a third-party website
that provides advanced NHL analytics. End-of-season team statistics were
downloaded as a series of CSV files — one for each NHL team and season
since 2008. These files were combined into a single dataset representing
team-season level data. Column names and metadata that had corresponding
but syntactically different entries in the goalie dataset were
standardized to ensure consistency and facilitate proper merging
later.</p>
<p>After importing the CSV files into a separate notebook, the datasets
were inspected and cleaned to ensure consistency and accuracy. Data
dimensions, headers, and footers were checked, column types were
corrected where necessary, and missing values in key variables were
assessed. In particular, discrete numeric variables had to be manually
converted to integer types and certain string columns such as birth
country were converted to factors for easier analysis. Special attention
was given to height values, which were validated using the NHL website
to confirm accuracy. Emergency backup goalies were identified and
removed, as their inclusion would not provide meaningful insights into
trends among regular NHL goaltenders. Additionally, missing save
percentage values were discovered but left as is since this indicates a
goalie who played but did not face any shots. The final rankings for
2025 prospects were also missing, but this was expected since they had
not yet been released when data extraction occurred.</p>
<p>Several new variables were created to facilitate analysis and provide
easier data validation. Age variables were derived from the birth date
of goalies/prospects for both datasets. Additionally, a binary
“undersized” variable was introduced to classify goalies at least two
inches shorter than the league average for their respective seasons. A
subset of “established” goalies was also created by filtering for
goalies who had appeared in at least 25 games in a given season (or 22
for the 2024-2025 season as of March 13th). This threshold follows the
NHL website’s default threshold for displaying goalie statistics and is
useful for ensuring trends are true for goalies who get consistent
playing time rather than one-time call-ups. Team statistics such as
expected goals against, blocked shots, and defensive zone giveaways were
standardized to rates per 60 minutes (rather than absolute season
totals) to enable meaningful comparisons across teams and seasons.</p>
<p>Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted using a range of
visualizations and statistical summaries. Line charts were created to
view trends in average goalie height over time, both league-wide and by
birth country. Similar visualizations were produced for prospects, with
goalies grouped by North American or international status. Histograms
and table summaries were used to examine the distributions of height,
SV%, GAA, and team statistics. Additionally, bar charts were generated
to show the number of NHL goalies by birth country for each season. To
assess the relationship between height and performance, league-wide SV%
and GAA were plotted over time, both overall and with goalies grouped by
undersized status. Correlations between individual attributes,
performance metrics, and team statistics were assessed visually and
numerically with scatterplots and correlation matrices. These tools
provided a structured approach to evaluating trends in NHL goaltender
height and performance over time.</p>
<p>Modelling and statistical analysis were conducted in R using the
<code>mgcv</code>, <code>randomForest</code>, <code>rpart</code>, and
<code>pdp</code> packages. Two sets of models were built: one to analyze
the relationship between goalie height and GAA, and another for SV%.
These two response variables differ in distributional characteristics:
GAA is a positive, continuous, typically right-skewed variable, while
SV% is a proportion bounded between 0 and 1. Accordingly, generalized
additive models (GAMs) were used for both responses with appropriate
distributional assumptions: a Gamma distribution with a log link for
GAA, and a Beta distribution with a logit link for SV%.</p>
<p>GAMs were selected for their flexibility in capturing non-linear
relationships between predictors and the response. Smooth terms were
applied to numeric variables that could plausibly affect performance.
These included individual characteristics such as height, weight, and
age, as well as team-level predictors like expected goals against per 60
minutes, blocked shots per 60 minutes, and defensive zone giveaways per
60 minutes. Categorical variables, including a goaltender’s team and
birth country, were incorporated as random effects to account for
group-level variation. A binary parametric term for the goaltender’s
catching hand was also included for completeness. Model summaries were
examined with a focus on the effective degrees of freedom for smooth
terms and the percentage of deviance explained. The effective degrees of
freedom indicate the complexity of the fitted smooth (i.e., the number
of basis functions used to approximate the relationship), while deviance
explained serves as an analogue to R² in non-Gaussian models. It is
important to note that model performance and predictive accuracy were
not the primary focus of this analysis; no train/test split or RMSE
calculations were conducted. Instead, the emphasis was placed on
interpretability, with the primary objective being to understand whether
goalie height meaningfully impacts performance.</p>
<p>To further compare interpretability, each GAM was matched with a pair
of tree-based models: a regression decision tree (<code>rpart</code>)
and a random forest (<code>randomForest</code>). Decision trees provide
interpretable, rule-based splits, which can reveal height thresholds
associated with changes in SV% or GAA. Random forests, which are
ensembles of decision trees built on bootstrapped samples and random
feature subsets, were used to assess variable importance and capture
complex interactions. Partial dependence plots (PDPs) were used to
visualize the marginal effect of height on the response in tree-based
models, enabling comparison with the smooth height effects from the
GAMs. This multi-model approach allowed for a robust assessment of
whether height influences goalie performance, offering insights into
both statistical significance and practical effect size across modelling
frameworks.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<div id="variable-overview" class="section level3">
<h3>Variable Overview</h3>
<p>Over the past 25 years, NHL goalies have varied in height from 5’7”
(67 inches) to 6’7” (79 inches) with an average height of about 6’2” (74
inches), as seen in Table 1. Similarly, Table 3 shows that these numbers
are comparable for NHL goalie prospects. This indicates a consistent
preference for taller goalies in the NHL. Save percentage and goals
against average show significant variation among all goalies, ranging
from 0.500 to 1.000 and 0.00 to 27.23, respectively. This is largely due
to inconsistencies in the number of games played for goalies. When
focusing only on established goaltenders, however, SV% and GAA fall
within a tighter range of .870 to 0.939 and 1.66 to 4.23, respectively,
as shown in Table 2. This reflects greater stability in performance
metrics for goalies with more playing time.</p>

<p>In terms of where NHL goalies have been born, Figure 1 shows how the
distribution of NHL goaltenders by birth country has changed over the
past 20 years. The figure illustrates how North America — particularly,
Canada — has been the biggest producer of NHL goaltenders during this
period. It appears, however, that the number of Canadian goalies in the
NHL has gradually decreased while the number of international goalies
has increased.</p>

<p>Figure 2 summarizes the relationships between goalie height, season,
GAA, and SV%. As expected, GAA and SV% are strongly negatively
correlated (r = -0.84), since a lower GAA typically coincides with a
higher save percentage. Height shows only a very weak positive
correlation with SV% (r = 0.03) and a near-zero correlation with GAA (r
= –0.01), suggesting that there is little to no linear relationship
between height and basic performance metrics. Interestingly, season is
moderately correlated with GAA (r = 0.21), SV% (r = -0.20), and height
(r = 0.26), indicating that goaltending performance and height has
changed over time.</p>

<h3>Trends in Height</h3>
<p>Our analysis reveals a clear trend in NHL goaltender height over
time. As shown in Figure 3, the average height of NHL goalies has
increased steadily since 2000, rising from approximately 6’0.5” (72.5
inches) to roughly 6’3” (75 inches) in recent seasons. The minimum
height of NHL goaltenders has also increased from 5’7” (67 inches) in
2000, to 5’10” (70 inches) in 2005, and finally to 5’11” (71 inches) in
2019, as demonstrated by Figure 4.</p>

<p>The upward trend in NHL goalie height appears consistent across most
birth countries, though Figure 5 highlights subtle differences across
the four biggest NHL goaltender-producing countries (i.e. Canada, the
United States, Finland, and Sweden). Compared to goaltenders from
Finland and Sweden, goalies from Canada and the United States show a
relatively more consistent increase in average height. While Canada and
Finland’s averages are currently around 6’3” (75 inches), the average is
slightly lower for the United States at 6’2.5” (74.5 inches) and
considerably higher for Sweden at around 6’4.5” (76.5 inches). Among
draft-eligible prospects, Figure 6 shows a less significant pattern.
Similar to NHL goalies, the average height of North American prospects
has stayed close to 6’2” (74 inches) with relatively similar growth
trends as the overall population. International goalies, on the other
hand, have varied between 6’1” (73 inches) and 6’3” (75 inches) over the
last 14 years. It is worth noting, however, that the number of ranked
international goalies per year has been consistently less than the North
American class, which could explain the extra variance.</p>

<h3>Trends in Performance</h3>
<p>From a statistical perspective, NHL goaltending performance has
decreased over the past decade. Figure 7 demonstrates that the
league-wide average save percentage has trended downwards since the
2014-15 season, starting at 0.915 and finishing at 0.901. As expected,
the league-wide goals against average increased over the same period
from 2.50 in 2014-15 to 2.80 in 2024-25, while peaking at 2.96 in
2022-23. This decrease (shown in Figure 8) is likely driven by a newer
generation of offensive talent who have learned increasingly dynamic and
creative scoring techniques that goaltenders have not yet fully adapted
to — though this remains speculative. Comparable numbers and trends are
prevalent when strictly analyzing established goalies. This makes sense
given that approximately 85% of the shots against and 84% of the goals
against in the past 25 years have been on established goalies.</p>

<h3>Trends in Height and Performance</h3>
<p>Visually, there appears to be little difference in performance
between shorter and taller goalies. Figures 9 and 10 illustrate this by
comparing the average SV% and GAA for both groups over the past 25
years. As shown in Figure 9, save percentages have remained relatively
similar across most seasons, regardless of height. Likewise, Figure 10
reveals a comparable trend in GAA, suggesting that height does not play
a significant role in these performance metrics.</p>

<h3>GAA Models</h3>
<p>The GAM for GAA, fit with a Gamma distribution and log link,
explained approximately 44.1% of deviance with an adjusted R² of 0.414.
The model coefficients are summarized in Table 4 and Table 5 below.
Among the smooth terms included, team expected goals against per 60
minutes was by far the strongest predictor of GAA (p-value &lt; 2e-16).
Meanwhile height was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.398).
The effective degrees of freedom (EDF) for the smooth height term was
1.00, indicating a nearly linear and weak effect. Visually inspecting
the smooth term in Figure 11 suggests a slight negative relationship
between height and GAA — meaning taller goalies tended to allow fewer
goals — but the effect size was minimal and very uncertain.</p>

<p>The regression tree model for GAA did not include height among its
splitting variables, as shown in Figure 12. Instead, it primarily relied
on team identity, birth country, and expected goals against per 60,
suggesting that contextual team factors were more predictive of GAA than
physical attributes like height. This aligns with the GAM findings,
where team-level defensive metrics dominated model significance.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Similarly, the random forest model explained 35.5% of variance, which
was notably lower than the GAM. As displayed in Figure 13, variable
importance rankings indicated that height was relatively unimportant,
with only a 7.1% increase in mean squared error when permuted. This
ranks height behind factors such as team, season, and birth country.
Nonetheless, the partial dependence plot for height (shown in Figure 14)
shows a weak trend consistent with the GAM: shorter goalies exhibited
slightly higher GAA, though the effect was marginal and non-linear.</p>

<h3>SV% Models</h3>
<p>The GAM for SV%, using a Beta distribution with a logit link,
explained 25% of deviance with an adjusted R² of 0.215. The model
coefficients are summarized in Table 6 and Table 7 below. As in the GAA
model, team-level expected goals against per 60 minutes was one of the
strongest predictors (p-value &lt; 2e-16), while height was not
statistically significant (p-value = 0.259). The smooth term for height
had an EDF of 1.00, suggesting a weak and nearly linear relationship. As
shown in Figure 15, the estimated smooth function showed a slight
increase in SV% with height, but the effect size was small and not
statistically meaningful.</p>

<p>The fitted regression decision tree for SV% similarly did not use
height in any of its splits, as shown in Figure 16. Instead, the most
important variables were again team identity, birth country, and
expected goals against per 60, reinforcing the pattern observed in the
GAA models.</p>

<p>The random forest model for SV% explained only 17.0% of variance,
performing worse than the GAM in terms of explanatory power. As
displayed in Figure 17, variable importance scores placed height near
the bottom of the predictor list, with only a 7.7% increase in mean
squared error when permuted — well below other features like team,
season, and birth country. The partial dependence plot for height (shown
in Figure 18) demonstrates a subtle, positive trend: very short goalies
tend to have slightly lower SV%, but this relationship is weak and
potentially misleading.</p>

<h2>Conclusions and Summary</h2>
<p>This analysis confirms that NHL goaltenders have become increasingly
taller over the past 25 years, reinforcing the league’s apparent
preference for taller goalies. This trend is consistent across most
major goaltender-producing countries, with Sweden currently leading the
way in average goaltender height. A similar, though more variable,
pattern was observed in drafted goalie prospects, especially among
international players.</p>
<p>The demographic landscape of NHL goaltending has also shifted over
time. While Canadian goalies once dominated the position, there has been
a noticeable decline in their relative presence, coinciding with a rise
in international goaltenders. This reflects a broader globalization of
goalie development, with more countries now producing NHL-caliber
talent.</p>
<p>However, despite the league’s growing emphasis on taller goalies, the
modelling results suggest that height alone is not a strong determinant
of performance. Across both SV% and GAA, GAMs indicated that height had
at most a weak, linear relationship with performance metrics — one that
was not statistically significant in either model. Tree-based models
reinforced this result, as height did not emerge as a key predictor in
any decision paths or variable importance rankings. Instead, team
context (e.g., team-level expected goals against) and birth country were
consistently more influential predictors of goaltender performance.</p>
<p>Although the smooth functions in the GAMs and partial dependence
plots in the random forests suggest that shorter goalies may
underperform slightly, especially at the extremes, these trends were
subtle and may reflect other correlated factors such as experience or
team quality.</p>
<p>Importantly, these findings should be interpreted with several
limitations in mind. The analysis focused on high-level summary metrics
(GAA and SV%), which, while widely used, do not capture finer aspects of
goaltender performance like shot quality faced, rebound control, or
positioning. Additionally, the models were not validated on separate
test data, as the primary aim was to explore interpretable patterns
rather than maximize predictive accuracy. Finally, although height was
modelled flexibly, potential interactions with playing style, coaching
systems, or workload were not explicitly tested and could influence
performance in more subtle ways.</p>
<p>Overall, while taller goalies continue to be favored in NHL scouting
and development, there is little statistical evidence that height alone
is a meaningful driver of performance. Instead, goaltender success
appears to depend more on situational context, skill, and team
environment than on physical stature.</p>
